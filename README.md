Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.- Using splinter navigate through [JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image](https://spaceimages-mars.com/) and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image.- Visit the [Mars Facts](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/) webpage and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc. and use Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.- Visit the [astrology](https://marshemispheres.com/) site to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres and create a dictionary.### Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application:- Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.	- convert your Jupyter notebook into a Python script with a function called scrape that returns one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.	- create a route called /scrape that will import your scrape_mars.py script and call your scrape function.	- Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.	- Create a root route / that will query your Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.	- Create a template HTML file called index.html that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements.## Screen Shots![Final App](./Missions_to_Mars/Images/final_app.png) ## Technologies and Tools* Jupyter Notebook* Visual Studio code editor#### Python Libraries* pandas* flask/jinja* Web Scraping libraries	* Splinter	* Requests	* BeautifulSoup4	* webdriver_manager		## Code - [mission_to_mars.ipynb](/Missions_to_Mars/mission_to_mars.ipynb)- [scrape_mars.py](/Missions_to_Mars/scrape_mars.py)- [Flask app.py](/Missions_to_Mars/app.py)## Setup1.
